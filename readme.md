ZigBeeForDomoticz is a plugin for [Domoticz home automation software](https://www.domoticz.com/) to connect Zigbee devices through Zigbee coordinator (ZigBee hubs/gateways/bridges/controllers/adapters/dongles/sticks/keys).
This plugin is an evolution of the mature Zigate plugin, which will continue to manage and handle ZiGates in native mode, while the others will be handle through unified communication libraries from the [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy) project.
