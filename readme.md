## Zigbee for Domoticz

Zigbee for Domoticz a plugin for [Domoticz home automation software](https://www.domoticz.com/) to connect Zigbee devices through Zigbee cooridnators (Zigbee controllers), like [ZiGate](https://zigate.fr), as well as Texas Instruments CC253x/CC13x2/CC26x2 Zigbee adapters/dongles/sticks/keys like [zzh](https://electrolama.com/projects/zig-a-zig-ah/).

This plugin is an evolution of the mature Zigate plugin for Domoticz, which will continue to manage and handle Zigate in native mode, while Texas Instruments's will be handle through unified communication libraries from the [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy) project.

## Compatibility WARNINGS

### REQUIRES Domoticz 2020 or above

The plugin requires Domoticz 2020 or above. We strongly recommend 2021.1 or above
If you cannot be on Domoticz 2020.x or above, please use the 'stable' branch which is the only one compatible with the oldest Domoticz version

### Tested Hardware Zigbee adapters/dongles/sticks/keys 

The plugin was originally developed for the [Zigate](https://zigate.fr) controller in close relationship with [Zigate](https://zigate.fr) manufactuer.

Since late 2021 where we have started opening the plugin to further brands of Zigbee Coordinators and begun focusing on compatibility with the [zzh](https://electrolama.com/projects/zig-a-zig-ah/) from [Electrolama](https://electrolama.com), thanks to their sponsorship.

Any Texas Instruments CC2531, CC13x2, CC26x2 adapters based on the [Zigbee Network Processors](http://dev.ti.com/tirex/content/simplelink_zigbee_sdk_plugin_2_20_00_06/docs/zigbee_user_guide/html/zigbee/introduction.html ) should be supported, more information could be found on [zigpy-znp](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-znp) which provided the layer to interface with the coordinator.

You can also find a list of [Texas Instruments supported adapters](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/adapters/#recommended) which also works with [zigpy-znp](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-znp) and as such should also work with this plugin

## LIMITATIONS

* Please do consider that the current plugin is limited to create a maximum of 255 "Widgets" (Domoticz devices).  This will still give you the possibility to integrate a large number of Zigbee devices , but not an unlimited number.
