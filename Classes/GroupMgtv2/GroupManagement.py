#  This is the Version 2 of Zigate Plugin Group Management.
#  
#  The aim of this Class is to be able to manage groups as they were in the previous version, 
#  but also to have instant groupmembership provisioning instead of the batch approach of the previous version.
#  
#  Important, the aim is not to break any upward compatibility
#  
#  Group management rely on 2 files:
#  
#  - ZigateGroupsConfig -xx.json which contains the Group configuration/definition
#  - GroupsList-xx.pck which contains somehow a cash of what is available on each devices 
#                      (1) will be converted to a JSON format
#  
#  
#  DATA STRUCTURES
#  
#  - Each device knowns its group membership. ( ListOfDevices)
#    Today there is an attribute 'GroupMgt' which is a list of Group with a status
#    V2 attribute 'GroupMembership' which is a dictionary of Group the device is member of.
#      - GroupId
#         - Status: TobeAdd, AddedReq, Ok, Error, ToBeRemoved, RemovedReq
#         - TimeStamp (when the Status has been set)
#  
#  - ListOfGroups is the Data structure supporting Groups
#    ListOfGroups[group id]['Name']            - Group Name as it will be created in Domoticz
#    ListOfGroups[group id]['Devices']         - List of Devices associed to this group on Zigate
#    ListOfGroups[group id]['Tradfri Remote']  - Manage the Tradfri Remote
#  
#  
#  
#  SYNOPSIS
#  
#  - At plugin start, if the group cash file exist, read and populate the data structure.
#                     if the cash doesn't exist, request to each Main Powered device tfor their existing group membership.
#                     collect the information and populate the data structure accordingly.
#  
#  - When the data structure is fully loaded, the object will be full operational and able to handle the following request
#      - adding group  membership to a specific device
#      - removing group membership to a specific device
#      - view group membership
#  
#      - actioning ( On, Off, LevelControl, ColorControl , WindowCovering )
#  
#      - Managing device short address changes ( could be better to store the IEEE )
